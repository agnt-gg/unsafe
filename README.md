# UNSAFE — Upfront Non-Speculative Agreement for Founding Equity (Template)

*A founder and investor-friendly, profit-first alternative to YC’s SAFE.*

---

## Overview

Most early-stage investments are designed for the “raise or die” venture treadmill — founders are pushed into endless funding rounds, while investors wait years for a distant IPO or acquisition.

**UNSAFE flips the model:**

* **\[Equity %]** equity for **\[\$ Amount]** in a profit-driven, high-margin business.
* No obligation to raise future rounds (but the option remains if mutually agreed).
* After **\[X years]**, founder may offer to buy back **up to \[X%]** of investor’s original shares at **\[X×]** the original purchase price.
* Investor can accept for early liquidity or keep all equity and participate in ongoing profits indefinitely.

**Philosophy:**

> "Cash machine, not unicorn chase." — real ownership, real cashflow, real choice for both founders and investors.

| Investor Ownership at Signing  | Immediate **\[Equity %]** equity issued today                                         | 0% now — converts later at priced round                |
| Future Fundraising Requirement | None — no obligation to raise again                                                   | Expected — conversion only at future priced round      |
